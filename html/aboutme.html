                <p>I'm a Junior in Highschool with a month or so experience in Web Dev. I caught an interest to this field when I went with my Dad to his work (Developer for Blue Cross Blue Sheild) and saw what he was doing. I like to do things that challenge my brain like solving Rubiks cubes and the very mental game of Golf. </p>
                <p>Due to the fact that I am just in Highschool I am just learning about the world of coding, so I am sure I will broaden my horizons and find more ways to work with the world of code.</p>
